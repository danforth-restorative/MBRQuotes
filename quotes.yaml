- "#NonviolentCommunication training shows people how to create peace within themselves and at the same time how to create connections with other people that allows compassionate giving to take place naturally.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "It was through studying [compassionate] people, and also some research in psychology, that I tried to identify what characteristics of development contribute to people's behaving in a compassionate way.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "I saw that the intention I wanted to live by, that I thought necessary for compassionate giving, is that we give solely out of the joy that comes naturally from contributing to life. Our own life and the lives of others.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "To maintain domination structures, a core component is to educate people with a static language that uses the verb to be in ways that judge people, their behavior, their appearance, their intelligence.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Teaching people to think in a static way, in terms of good/bad, right/wrong, normal/abnormal, appropriate/inappropriate, mentally normal/mentally ill, combined with retributive justice based on punishment and reward, I believe, is at the heart of violence on our planet."
- "This is a radical departure from the language of domination, a language of judging what people are.\n\nNonviolent communication suggest clarity about whether actions are supporting needs being fulfilled.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Anytime we get people to do things out of fear that we're going to punish them if they don't, or out of shame or guilt, it's very costly. We are then experienced as a source of violence, as somebody who is prepared to make them suffer if they don't do what we want."
- "It simply says, Let's stay connected to life, the life within us. Like any other form of life, whether it be a tree or animals, life requires being connected enough to life to know how to fulfill our needs. So in that sense, Nonviolent Communication is a very simple process."
- "The reason it's so difficult is that it requires liberating ourselves from centuries of education that have buried what's alive in us. Cultural education that is designed to make us nice dead people, not compassionate living people.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Anger, Depression, Guilt, Shame\n\nWhenever we're feeling those feelings, we're thinking in a way that we've been taught to think for about 10,000 years. A way of thinking designed to make us obedient to authority, but is not conducive to safety and peace on our planet."
- "Anger is caused by how you think, language that is disconnected from your needs, and makes violence enjoyable. #NVC #NonviolentCommunication  #NonviolentCommunication"
- "We can only be angry when we get disconnected from life, and go up to our head, and think in a way we have been programmed to think, in terms of wrongness of the other person.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "I'm not saying there's anything wrong with being angry. That would be unfortunate if I come across that way, because a lot of people have been educated to think that if you're a nice person, you don't get angry. They've been taught to repress their anger. I'm certainly not saying that."
- "No matter what you might say to them, do you think you are more likely to come out with your needs met if, in your head you have judgments of them implying wrongness on their part, or if you are conscious of your needs?\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "I was very skilled at judging what's wrong with other people in a way that would make me angry. But I wasn't very skilled at understanding my needs, getting connected to my needs.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "In the exercise where I have asked people to identify what they tell themselves when they have made a mistake. Once they identify this thinking, I then suggest that they transform that thinking into the need that wasn't met, that stimulated the thinking."
- "All of the thinking that makes us angry, depressed, guilt or shame is a tragic expression of an unmet need. To really learn from this mistake without losing self respect we need to mourn but to mourn without blaming."
- "We need to see what we can be responsible for, and what we are not responsible for. When we get this mixed up, we can be victimized by guilt tripping.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"

- "Retributive justice judges people as right or wrong, good or bad - with attachment to - if you are good, right, appropriate, etc, you deserve to be rewarded, but if you are bad, wrong, etc. you deserve to suffer, be punished, etc.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "We can learn by clear observations, but when the observations and evaluations are mixed together, so that it sounds like a criticism, it makes the evaluation period painful for both sides.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "This form of evaluation requires a literacy of feelings, that we tell people how we feel when they behave in a certain way.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Not only aren't we educated to speak a language of life, a language of feelings, we have been given a cultural education that has a very negative connotation to many of our emotions.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "This requires a need consciousness, and a need literacy, which is not easy to come about. Because, once again, the structures in which we have been living for a long time, require us to be educated in a way, in which, we are not connected to our needs."
- "Men tell me how difficult it is to express their needs. How they have been taught that brave men have no needs, so they're willing to sacrifice their lives for the king or for the flag.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "In our training, we suggest to be sure that you learn how to be honest without any criticism without any blame, without any judgment of a kind where people hear that what they're doing is bad or wrong.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Max-Neef classifies the fundamental human needs as: subsistence, protection, affection, understanding, participation, recreation (in the sense of leisure, time to reflect, or idleness), creation, identity and freedom.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "In nonviolent communication, we tell people what we do want, rather than what we don't want.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "One reason people use more words than anybody wants to hear is that the speaker is not conscious of what they want back. They don't understand what their own present request is, and so they keep going on and on, when they're not even too sure what they want in the conversation."
- "She said, Okay, Marshall, I got your point. I see what's going on. I see why I'm not getting my need for love met.\n\nWhy is that? What do you want him to do to meet your need for love?\n\nI want him to guess what I want before I know what it is, and I want him always to do it"
- "Some people use the word love as a feeling. Nonviolent communication suggests that we use the word love solely as a need and not as a feeling. If we're trying to express emotions, then use other words beside love for describing what we are feeling."
- "If we're addicted to our strategy, it's very easy for the other person to hear a request as a demand, this threatens their need for autonomy, and makes it harder for them to enjoy giving.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "We need to say clearly what we want. But the objective is to create a connection and then which everybody's needs get met through compassionate giving.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "State the need that is the cause of the feeling, or guess the need that caused the feeling in the other person, and ask.\n\nTuning into the feeling, you can often find the underlying need.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "If a person starts to talk about some pain they're having, the other person might say, \"I'm so sad that you're going through this suffering.\"\n\nThat sadness and caring on the part of this person could probably be well received if the person in pain first received empathy."
- "How do you tell somebody that when you tell me \"how sad you are\", and start to give me advice, I know you mean well, but it's not only not what I need, it actually stimulates more pain. It leaves me feeling more lonely with that pain.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "We go to the feelings and needs being distorted by the thoughts that criticize oneself or others. To do that will require some guessing, some sensing, of what the feelings and needs might be. Because the speaker is not directly saying, this means we'll be wrong some of the time."
- "I was trained to try to help people connect the present problems they're having with things that happened earlier in their life to get them insights into this.\n\nIt took me quite a few years to realize how much more powerful it was for me to empathically connect with them, rather than to intellectually analyze how their problems began"
- "I suggest to hear what is the person feeling and needing when they say that. We'll learn a lot about what's going on by doing that. We'll show the person we are more interested in the connection with them than in their immediately responding to our request."
- "To interrupt them when you have heard more words than you want to hear, and when the words are not really connecting you clearly to what is alive in the person.\n\nSay, \"Excuse me\" and then what we say is to bring the conversation back to life, back to what is alive in this person at this moment, behind all the words."
- "Here's where I might interrupt, but I would interrupt to try to connect to what's alive and then now, behind all these words.\n\nI might say excuse me, excuse me for interrupting but I really want to be sure I'm connecting to what you want me to hear by telling me this."
- "If somebody says 'no' to us, that can't make us feel bad, it's how we interpret the no. We lose this consciousness as we get educated so that interdependence is not what happens in intimate relationships, but co-dependence, where people take on responsibility for each other's happiness."
- "To say no:\n\n- We empathically connect with the other person's needs, silently or verbally.\n- We say our need that keeps us from saying yes.\n- We end on a request that searches for a way to get everybody's needs met.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "How can I let you know what my needs are, and what I'm requesting of you, so that you can believe that I only want you to do it if you can do it joyfully, that it's not giving in or giving up?\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Respect for authority, as I use the term, is manifest when we know things that people don't know, or can do things that they don't know how to do.\n\nThey see that these things are very valuable and they see that these things are being offered to them and not imposed upon them"
- "Respect for authority needs to be earned. We need to clearly communicate with people so they can see the value of what we're offering.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "When we are in this position of authority called parent, if we don't watch out, we allow our cultural training to lead us to treat this person we label as our child in a way that's far less respectful and caring than people we would label as our neighbors."
- "I would hope that we would show the quality of honesty where we revealed our own feelings and needs and request, not criticism and demands. Whether this person is 3 or 53\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Very often the institutions that we're in might not be set up to maintain the kind of values that we hold within ourselves.\n\nIt's extremely important that we learn how not to give away our power to authority. \n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "When we are in a position of authority, it is not the objective to control people. It is to offer people what we have to offer, from my position of authority, but not to impose it.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Carl Rogers said, I have the belief that the most important part of learning is to wonder: \"what's worth learning?\"\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "I would like us all to do some wondering and on the basis of this wondering, take actions that free us from authority and institutions that function in ways that are not conducive to our living the lives we choose to live.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "I'd like us to wonder whether we have fully developed our ability to see that person's humaneness, and that we can communicate with them and show them other ways of getting all needs met, beside the ways that we have been trained to use power within domination systems."
- "We all have this ability to learn how to listen empathically to one another, and to contribute to one another, transforming this pain.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "I think we can heal from this situation, if you can tell me what's alive in you now, as a result of what happened in the past\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "I've asked people what their needs are, but they don't tell me their needs. \n\nThey're very literate telling me what they think about themselves, in a way that implies there is something wrong with them. \n\nThat's the kind of thinking I believe contributes to depression."
- "These judgments that we make of ourselves that stimulate depression are simply expressions of unmet needs\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "All of those judgments are really valuable messages – if we hear the truth – that what they're really trying to say is a need of mine is not getting met by what I'm doing\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Help people to become conscious that these judgments they're telling themselves, that create misery, contain valuable information if we can hear the needs that are not getting met.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Nonviolent communication provides us with skills for clearly expressing our needs without criticizing the other person\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "It took about an hour just to get both sides to express a need and to hear the other side's needs. At that point, one of the chiefs who hadn't spoken yet said to me, Marshall, if we know how to communicate this way, we don't have to kill each other."
- "I'm convinced we don't have to have violence if we can learn how to connect with each other's needs.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Gangs that I'm worried about, some of them call themselves governments, some call themselves corporations – organizations of people that have a big impact over our lives, and are doing some things that I think contribute to great violence on the planet, and great suffering."
- "One way that Nonviolent Communication support us, is to help us to look inside and see how do I want to meet this important need of mine, to serve life?\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "I showed them that I thought it would be more effective if we created signs that purely communicated our needs and our intent, but in no way implied that we saw the people at the school as evil or bad.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "A real consciousness of what is happening that's creating the violence mobilizes us to create change, not just hope that by purifying ourselves the energy coming from us will create change.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "One of my social change objectives for the last several years has been to do what I can do to contribute to transforming our judicial system from one based on the concept of retributive justice to one based on restorative justice.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication #RestorativeJustice"
- "I'm talking about the kind of spirituality, based on the concept that there are superiors who know what is right, and who on the basis of their judgments have the right to punish or reward people.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication #RestorativeJustice"
- "#RestorativeJustice has as its purpose, to find ways of getting everyone's needs met so that peace and harmony can be retrieved when pain and conflict exists between parties.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "We want to restore the situation by replacing whatever education led to this person behaving as they did with an education that supports their contributing to people's well being, rather than doing things which create suffering for people. #RestorativeJustice"
- "It's a process that helps us to share that information with others, how to be honest and share what's alive in us – in a way that enables others to enjoy compassionately giving to us.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "It has been my experience that there is nothing more fulfilling for human beings than when they exercise this power to enrich life and get confirmation that they have done so they can really experience how their efforts have enriched other people's lives."

- "In nonviolent communication we evaluate from the heart. We make need serving judgments. We judge whether what people are doing is meeting needs or not.
