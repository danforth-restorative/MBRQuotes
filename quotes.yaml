- "#NVC can be effectively applied at all levels of communication and in diverse situations: intimate relationships, families, schools, organizations and institutions, therapy and counseling, diplomatic and business negotiations, disputes and conflicts of any nature."
- "There are the two main reasons we don't get our needs met.\n\nFirst, we don't know how to express our needs to begin with.\n\nSecond, if we do, we forget to put a clear request after it, or we use vague words like appreciate, listen, recognize, know, be real, and stuff like that."
- "As #NVC replaces our old patterns of defending, withdrawing or attacking in the face of judgment and criticism. We come to perceive ourselves and others, as well as our intentions and relationships, in a new light. Resistance, defensiveness, and violent reactions are minimized."
- "Some use #NVC to respond compassionately to themselves, some to create greater depth in their personal relationships, and still others to build effective relationships at work or in the political arena.\n\nWorldwide, NVC is used to mediate disputes and conflicts at all levels."
- "If I'm using Nonviolent Communication I never, never, never hear what somebody thinks about me. Never hear what somebody thinks about you, you'll live longer. You'll enjoy life more.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"

- "#NonviolentCommunication training shows people how to create peace within themselves and at the same time how to create connections with other people that allows compassionate giving to take place naturally.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "I found that the tools of psychoanalytic therapy, and other trainings which were current at the time, didn't work very well.\n\nInstead of diagnosing what it was in people that's wrong with them, I decided to start with a different question: \n\nHow were we meant to live?"
- "The skills that seem necessary to live compassionately are quite different than the skills that we're taught.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Structures we're living in, where some claim to be superior and know what's right for others, requires a certain way of thinking, a certain language, and a certain use of power\n\nI saw that was the problem. What creates violence is that way of thinking, language, and use of power"
- "It was through studying [compassionate] people, and also some research in psychology, that I tried to identify what characteristics of development contribute to people's behaving in a compassionate way.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "I saw that the intention I wanted to live by, that I thought necessary for compassionate giving, is that we give solely out of the joy that comes naturally from contributing to life. Our own life and the lives of others.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "The purpose of nonviolent communication is to provide us with the language with the thinking, communication means of influence that support and connecting with ourselves and others in a way that promotes compassionate giving.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "To maintain domination structures, a core component is to educate people with a static language that uses the verb to be in ways that judge people, their behavior, their appearance, their intelligence.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Retributive justice basically implies that if you are judged as bad by the authorities, you deserve to suffer for it. If you are judged by authorities as good, then you deserve to be rewarded.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Teaching people to think in a static way, in terms of good/bad, right/wrong, normal/abnormal, appropriate/inappropriate, mentally normal/mentally ill, combined with retributive justice based on punishment and reward, I believe, is at the heart of violence on our planet."
- "Nonviolent communication focuses our attention on human needs, whether human needs are being fulfilled or not. When they're not, obviously what is called for, is to find ways we can behave that nurture these needs. This is a radically different way of thinking."
- "Instead of judging right or wrong, to determine whether people are punished or not, are rewarded or not; nonviolent communication focuses on what is happening to our needs.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "This is a radical departure from the language of domination, a language of judging what people are.\n\nNonviolent communication suggest clarity about whether actions are supporting needs being fulfilled.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "When we see that our needs are not being fulfilled, we need to request of ourselves or others, what actions we would like taken to better meet our needs.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Nonviolent communication involves sharing what's alive in us. What would make life more wonderful? to receive the same information from other people, to connect with what's alive in them, and what would make life more wonderful for them.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "We want people to know that we never want anything done, that we request, out of guilt or shame created by criticism they hear coming from us.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Schools, families, and governments are all set up on the basis of retributive justice, the idea that there are certain things you must do, and if you don't you deserve to suffer, and if you do things defined as right by authorities, then you deserve to be rewarded."
- "Anytime we get people to do things out of fear that we're going to punish them if they don't, or out of shame or guilt, it's very costly. We are then experienced as a source of violence, as somebody who is prepared to make them suffer if they don't do what we want."
- "Asked for examples of Amtssprache, Eichmann said it's a language in which you deny responsibility for your actions. If you don't feel responsible for your actions, you don't feel so bad when you do things like send people to their death.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "It simply says, Let's stay connected to life, the life within us. Like any other form of life, whether it be a tree or animals, life requires being connected enough to life to know how to fulfill our needs. So in that sense, Nonviolent Communication is a very simple process."
- "The reason it's so difficult is that it requires liberating ourselves from centuries of education that have buried what's alive in us. Cultural education that is designed to make us nice dead people, not compassionate living people.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Anger, Depression, Guilt, Shame\n\nWhenever we're feeling those feelings, we're thinking in a way that we've been taught to think for about 10,000 years. A way of thinking designed to make us obedient to authority, but is not conducive to safety and peace on our planet."
- "Anger is caused by how you think, language that is disconnected from your needs, and makes violence enjoyable. #NVC #NonviolentCommunication  #NonviolentCommunication"
- "All you need to do to make violence enjoyable is think there's bad guys, and that these bad guys deserve to suffer for what they've done. That can make it enjoyable for you to create pain for these people.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "We can only be angry when we get disconnected from life, and go up to our head, and think in a way we have been programmed to think, in terms of wrongness of the other person.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "I'm not saying there's anything wrong with being angry. That would be unfortunate if I come across that way, because a lot of people have been educated to think that if you're a nice person, you don't get angry. They've been taught to repress their anger. I'm certainly not saying that."
- "No matter what you might say to them, do you think you are more likely to come out with your needs met if, in your head you have judgments of them implying wrongness on their part, or if you are conscious of your needs?\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "\"Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing, there is a field. I'll meet you there.\" - Rumi\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "I was very skilled at judging what's wrong with other people in a way that would make me angry. But I wasn't very skilled at understanding my needs, getting connected to my needs.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "One way in which we can make our own life much more enjoyable, is whenever we are thinking in a way that is causing anger, depression, guilt, or shame, to transform that thinking into what need of ours is being distorted by the thinking that's causing those feelings."
- "In the exercise where I have asked people to identify what they tell themselves when they have made a mistake. Once they identify this thinking, I then suggest that they transform that thinking into the need that wasn't met, that stimulated the thinking."
- "All of the thinking that makes us angry, depressed, guilt or shame is a tragic expression of an unmet need. To really learn from this mistake without losing self respect we need to mourn but to mourn without blaming."
- "We suggest that everyone build at least a vocabulary of about nine words that describe various needs that you have and see if one of those words, or more, resonate when you're blaming yourself.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Be conscious of what you tell yourself as a result of making the mistake, and translate the self-judgment into an unmet need. That's mourning.\n\nThen empathize with what need you were trying to meet by the action that we're calling a mistake. That's self forgiveness."
- "When we think in the static language of what's wrong with us, that are we selfish, stupid, inconsiderate.\n\nWhen we have that language going on in us about ourselves, that doesn't lead to us getting our needs met.\n\nOur needs are buried behind that kind of thinking."
- "We need to see what we can be responsible for, and what we are not responsible for. When we get this mixed up, we can be victimized by guilt tripping.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "The goal of life isn't to be perfect. It's to become progressively less stupid.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Keep in mind that anything that's worth doing is worth doing poorly.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "We didn't judge students as bad, but we spoke honestly with them about whether or not their behavior was in harmony with our values or needs. We judge that way, but not judgments of a moralistic sort that implied wrongness.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "I was also in favor of rules, but that I showed him a different way of establishing rules based on the protective use of force and not the punitive use of force \n\nhttps://nvcnextgen.org/2018/10/on-the-punishment-and-the-protective-use-of-force-by-jim-manske/"
- "How concerned I am about thinking we have to be afraid of what other people might say or think about us.\n\nBy doing that, we're giving our power to other people.\n\nI tried to show people that we need to be concerned with how we respond the other person, not what they think of us."
- "Don't ever give up your security to the structures you're in, or to other people's messages toward you.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Retributive justice judges people as right or wrong, good or bad - with attachment to - if you are good, right, appropriate, etc, you deserve to be rewarded, but if you are bad, wrong, etc. you deserve to suffer, be punished, etc.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "It's very important to be able to made clear observations to people, that tell them what language on their part is stimulating our needs being fulfilled, and what things that are doing that are not fulfilling our needs.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "We can learn by clear observations, but when the observations and evaluations are mixed together, so that it sounds like a criticism, it makes the evaluation period painful for both sides.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "In nonviolent communication, we want to be sure that whenever we want to talk to somebody about something they're doing that we're not happy with, that we clearly put this in the form of an observation.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "When we tell people clearly our feelings and needs, we're letting them know what's alive in us when they do what they are doing, this is an evaluation based on life, not an evaluation, criticizes or blames.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "This form of evaluation requires a literacy of feelings, that we tell people how we feel when they behave in a certain way.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Many people use the word feeling and thought interchangeably. \n\nIn nonviolent communication, when we use the word feeling, we want it to refer to an emotion that a person is experiencing that doesn't contain any diagnosis or intellectual analysis of the other person"
- "Feelings would be:\n\nI feel frustration,\nI feel sadness,\nI feel irritation, when our needs are not getting met.\n\nWhen our needs are getting met:\n\nI feel happy.\nI feel joyful.\nI feel pleasure.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Not only aren't we educated to speak a language of life, a language of feelings, we have been given a cultural education that has a very negative connotation to many of our emotions.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "This requires a need consciousness, and a need literacy, which is not easy to come about. Because, once again, the structures in which we have been living for a long time, require us to be educated in a way, in which, we are not connected to our needs."
- "Men tell me how difficult it is to express their needs. How they have been taught that brave men have no needs, so they're willing to sacrifice their lives for the king or for the flag.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "In our training, we suggest to be sure that you learn how to be honest without any criticism without any blame, without any judgment of a kind where people hear that what they're doing is bad or wrong.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "In the United States, we measure the success of the measurements of the GNP, the gross national product, which essentially is how much money is made in certain areas.\n\nThat system shows that it's successful when the rich get richer and the poor get poorer."
- "Manfred Max-Neef approach to economic success is based on whether human needs are met by all of the parties in the culture.\n\nSince his whole system of economy is based on human needs, he's gone to some trouble to research what are the basic human needs\n\nhttp://www.rainforestinfo.org.au/background/maxneef.htm"
- "Max-Neef classifies the fundamental human needs as: subsistence, protection, affection, understanding, participation, recreation (in the sense of leisure, time to reflect, or idleness), creation, identity and freedom.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "In nonviolent communication, we tell people what we do want, rather than what we don't want.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "One reason people use more words than anybody wants to hear is that the speaker is not conscious of what they want back. They don't understand what their own present request is, and so they keep going on and on, when they're not even too sure what they want in the conversation."
- "She said, Okay, Marshall, I got your point. I see what's going on. I see why I'm not getting my need for love met.\n\nWhy is that? What do you want him to do to meet your need for love?\n\nI want him to guess what I want before I know what it is, and I want him always to do it"
- "Some people use the word love as a feeling. Nonviolent communication suggests that we use the word love solely as a need and not as a feeling. If we're trying to express emotions, then use other words beside love for describing what we are feeling."
- "If your intent is to get people to do what you want, that's a different intent than we need to have.\n\nIn nonviolent communication, it's never our objective to get what we want. It's to create the quality of connection with people that ends with everybody getting their needs met."
- "If we're addicted to our strategy, it's very easy for the other person to hear a request as a demand, this threatens their need for autonomy, and makes it harder for them to enjoy giving.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "We need to say clearly what we want. But the objective is to create a connection and then which everybody's needs get met through compassionate giving.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "State the need that is the cause of the feeling, or guess the need that caused the feeling in the other person, and ask.\n\nTuning into the feeling, you can often find the underlying need.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "The energy coming through people is, for me, a very beautiful divine energy. When I can really stay connected with it, I feel like I'm riding in a very precious flow of energy.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "One of the things that we need to stay clear about, is not to get mixed up intellectual understanding with empathy.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "If a person starts to talk about some pain they're having, the other person might say, \"I'm so sad that you're going through this suffering.\"\n\nThat sadness and caring on the part of this person could probably be well received if the person in pain first received empathy."
- "How do you tell somebody that when you tell me \"how sad you are\", and start to give me advice, I know you mean well, but it's not only not what I need, it actually stimulates more pain. It leaves me feeling more lonely with that pain.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Empathy involves:\n\n- presence\n- focus on the now\n- focus on feelings and needs.\n\nThat means not on thoughts. Most people are used to talking about their thoughts.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Many of the thoughts that people make, especially those that judge others or themselves, are really tragic expressions of what they're feeling and needing at that moment.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "We go to the feelings and needs being distorted by the thoughts that criticize oneself or others. To do that will require some guessing, some sensing, of what the feelings and needs might be. Because the speaker is not directly saying, this means we'll be wrong some of the time."
- "In nonviolent communication, we never try to be perfect. We try to be progressively less stupid.\n\nWe're conscious that anything that's worth doing is worth doing poorly.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "I was trained to try to help people connect the present problems they're having with things that happened earlier in their life to get them insights into this.\n\nIt took me quite a few years to realize how much more powerful it was for me to empathically connect with them, rather than to intellectually analyze how their problems began"
- "If we stay with their present feelings and needs, that gets them in touch with other deeper feelings and needs that are also going on within them. Sometimes this can take quite a while before the person really feels fully understood.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "I suggest to hear what is the person feeling and needing when they say that. We'll learn a lot about what's going on by doing that. We'll show the person we are more interested in the connection with them than in their immediately responding to our request."
- "To interrupt them when you have heard more words than you want to hear, and when the words are not really connecting you clearly to what is alive in the person.\n\nSay, \"Excuse me\" and then what we say is to bring the conversation back to life, back to what is alive in this person at this moment, behind all the words."
- "Here's where I might interrupt, but I would interrupt to try to connect to what's alive and then now, behind all these words.\n\nI might say excuse me, excuse me for interrupting but I really want to be sure I'm connecting to what you want me to hear by telling me this."
- "I was keeping a lot of myself hidden, because I was telling myself that I had to be afraid of what people might say to me. But then I started to realize I don't have to worry about what people say to me. I only have to worry about how I respond to that."
- "Some people use the word love as a feeling and emotion. If they do that, it's pretty hard to know how to answer that question without reference to a specific time and place because feelings change every few seconds.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "When I tricked myself into thinking I'm responsible for my partner's happiness, I'm taking on a job that I can't do. I can't make the other person happy.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "I can only be responsible for my own actions, my own intentions. The other person is responsible for how they take what I do, how they interpret it, and what they do to get their needs met.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "If somebody says 'no' to us, that can't make us feel bad, it's how we interpret the no. We lose this consciousness as we get educated so that interdependence is not what happens in intimate relationships, but co-dependence, where people take on responsibility for each other's happiness."
- "Many of the women I work with have a difficult time expressing their needs. They have internalized cultural programming that says that loving women have no needs. Ao demonstrate their love for others, they believe that you must suppress your needs in favor of the other person."
- "Men seemed to have real difficulty expressing their feelings, especially any feelings that imply vulnerability, like feeling hurt, or sad, or lonely. \n\nThey are educated in what I call the John Wayne concept of masculinity and not supposed to have such vulnerable feelings."
- "To say no:\n\n- We empathically connect with the other person's needs, silently or verbally.\n- We say our need that keeps us from saying yes.\n- We end on a request that searches for a way to get everybody's needs met.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "How can I let you know what my needs are, and what I'm requesting of you, so that you can believe that I only want you to do it if you can do it joyfully, that it's not giving in or giving up?\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "When we take responsibility for other people's feelings, rather than our own actions, that is when our giving is mixed. It doesn't contain the pure joy of giving that's necessary for relationships to be strengthened.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Respect for authority, as I use the term, is manifest when we know things that people don't know, or can do things that they don't know how to do.\n\nThey see that these things are very valuable and they see that these things are being offered to them and not imposed upon them"
- "Respect for authority needs to be earned. We need to clearly communicate with people so they can see the value of what we're offering.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "When we are in this position of authority called parent, if we don't watch out, we allow our cultural training to lead us to treat this person we label as our child in a way that's far less respectful and caring than people we would label as our neighbors."
