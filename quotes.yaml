- "Children need far more than basic skills in reading, writing, and math, as important as those might be.\n\nChildren also need to learn how to think for themselves, how to find meaning in what they learn, and how to work and live together.\n\n  #NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Teacher, school administrators and parents will come away from Life-Enriching Education with skills in language, communication, and ways of structuring the learning environment that support the development of autonomy and interdependence in the classroom."

- "When we express our needs indirectly through the use of evaluations, interpretations, and images, others are likely to hear criticism.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "To know how we can be peaceful with ourselves when we're less than perfect. \n\nFor example: How we can learn from our limitations without blaming and punishing our self?  \n\nIf we can't do that, I'm not too optimistic how we're going to relate peacefully out in the world."
- "I found that the tools of psychoanalytic therapy, and other trainings which were current at the time, didn't work very well.\n\nInstead of diagnosing what it was in people that's wrong with them, I decided to start with a different question: \n\nHow were we meant to live?"
- "I saw that the intention I wanted to live by, that I thought necessary for compassionate giving, is that we give solely out of the joy that comes naturally from contributing to life. Our own life and the lives of others.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "I'm not saying there's anything wrong with being angry. That would be unfortunate if I come across that way, because a lot of people have been educated to think that if you're a nice person, you don't get angry. They've been taught to repress their anger. I'm certainly not saying that."
- "He said, Dad, its taking you so long to talk.\n\nI said, let me tell you what I can say quickly, do it my way or I'll kick your butt!\n\nHe said, Take your time, dad.\n\nPeople who have known me in the days before I learned nonviolent communication are very patient when I take my time"
- "When we think in the static language of what's wrong with us, that are we selfish, stupid, inconsiderate.\n\nWhen we have that language going on in us about ourselves, that doesn't lead to us getting our needs met.\n\nOur needs are buried behind that kind of thinking."
- "Other people can't make us feel anything. Our feelings are a result of how we take things. We cannot make other people feel as they do. They are responsible for how they take it.\n\nWe show we're not responsible for how other people feel. We are responsible for our actions."
- "This kind of honesty basically involves telling people what's alive in us, without using any words that criticize, and tell people what would make life more wonderful for us, what we are requesting, without presenting this as a demand, but presented as a request."
- "It's very important to be able to made clear observations to people, that tell them what language on their part is stimulating our needs being fulfilled, and what things that are doing that are not fulfilling our needs.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "When we tell people clearly our feelings and needs, we're letting them know what's alive in us when they do what they are doing, this is an evaluation based on life, not an evaluation, criticizes or blames.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "In nonviolent communication, we tell people what we do want, rather than what we don't want.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "In nonviolent communication, we say what is alive in us: what we're observing, feeling, and needing. We make clear requests, presented, as best we can, in a way that people can trust it is a request and not a demand.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Saying no in a nonviolent communication way:\n\n- Show an empathic reception of the request of the other person.\n\n- We don't say \"no\", we say the need that keeps us from saying yes.\n\nWe end with a request that searches for a way to get everybody's needs met."

- "Empathy takes place in the now. If the other person is telling me about some things that happened to their life in the past that caused great pain in them, I put my focus on what is alive in them now when they're telling me this.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "I was trained to try to help people connect the present problems they're having with things that happened earlier in their life to get them insights into this.\n\nIt took me quite a few years to realize how much more powerful it was for me to empathically connect with them, rather than to intellectually analyze how their problems began"
- "To interrupt them when you have heard more words than you want to hear, and when the words are not really connecting you clearly to what is alive in the person.\n\nSay, \"Excuse me\" and then what we say is to bring the conversation back to life, back to what is alive in this person at this moment, behind all the words."
- "It's very important is to develop a consciousness that our needs are precious gift if they are expressed in a way in which we are not demanding that the person meet our request, in relationship to our needs.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "When we have this consciousness that our needs are a gift, we then express them with a totally different energy that makes it much easier for the other person to enjoy receiving our needs, and makes it much easier for them to respond out of the joy of giving."
- "If somebody says 'no' to us, that can't make us feel bad, it's how we interpret the no. We lose this consciousness as we get educated so that interdependence is not what happens in intimate relationships, but co-dependence, where people take on responsibility for each other's happiness."
- "If we're going to be good at expressing our needs, we want to be prepared to deal with somebody who gives us a diagnosis for having our needs.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Fear of authority is usually built into the structure of either the family, the school, the business, the government.\n\nThis structure gives us the right to impose things on people. We can reward or punish, to get people to do what we want.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"

- "No matter what structure I'm in, they may control the environment, but they can't control me. I'm free within any structure, to choose what I want to do, and why I want to do it.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "I would like us all to do some wondering and on the basis of this wondering, take actions that free us from authority and institutions that function in ways that are not conducive to our living the lives we choose to live.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "All of those judgments are really valuable messages – if we hear the truth – that what they're really trying to say is a need of mine is not getting met by what I'm doing\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "We all have the same human needs\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Gangs that I'm worried about, some of them call themselves governments, some call themselves corporations – organizations of people that have a big impact over our lives, and are doing some things that I think contribute to great violence on the planet, and great suffering."
- "I showed them that I thought it would be more effective if we created signs that purely communicated our needs and our intent, but in no way implied that we saw the people at the school as evil or bad.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"

- "A very important component in keeping this consciousness alive is the process of expressing gratitude to one another in a way that can be trusted that it's a celebration of life, and not a form of communication that's designed to manipulate us to do things that others want."
- "Our ability to express gratitude well, is highly correlated with how well we're able to express our pain, and receive empathy for our pain, and transform the pain.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "That means we often don't express gratitude, thinking it's the other person's duty and obligation, they shouldn't need any gratitude for it.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
