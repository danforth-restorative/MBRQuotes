- "I found that the tools of psychoanalytic therapy, and other trainings which were current at the time, didn't work very well.\n\nInstead of diagnosing what it was in people that's wrong with them, I decided to start with a different question: \n\nHow were we meant to live?"

- "Anger tells us, in other words, that a need of ours isn't getting met, but our thinking doesn't connect with that need. Our connection goes to judging the other person who was the stimulus for our anger.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "I'm not saying there's anything wrong with being angry. That would be unfortunate if I come across that way, because a lot of people have been educated to think that if you're a nice person, you don't get angry. They've been taught to repress their anger. I'm certainly not saying that."

- "When we think in the static language of what's wrong with us, that are we selfish, stupid, inconsiderate.\n\nWhen we have that language going on in us about ourselves, that doesn't lead to us getting our needs met.\n\nOur needs are buried behind that kind of thinking."
- "The structures we've been living under for a long time require people to be nice dead people.\n\nThey teach this language of blame, so that we're forever looking to authorities to see whether we're getting the right answer, or the wrong answer, whether we're judged as good or bad."
- "Other people can't make us feel anything. Our feelings are a result of how we take things. We cannot make other people feel as they do. They are responsible for how they take it.\n\nWe show we're not responsible for how other people feel. We are responsible for our actions."
- "Keep in mind that anything that's worth doing is worth doing poorly.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"

- "When we tell people clearly our feelings and needs, we're letting them know what's alive in us when they do what they are doing, this is an evaluation based on life, not an evaluation, criticizes or blames.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "We have been living under domination cultures in which some people claim to be superiors and have a right to control others. People do not make good slaves when they are connected to life, and so feelings are not regarded as a positive thing to say.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"

- "Manfred Max-Neef approach to economic success is based on whether human needs are met by all of the parties in the culture.\n\nSince his whole system of economy is based on human needs, he's gone to some trouble to research what are the basic human needs\n\nhttp://www.rainforestinfo.org.au/background/maxneef.htm"
- "Needs are also defined according to the existential categories of being, having, doing and interacting, and from these dimensions, a 36 cell matrix is developed which can be filled with examples of satisfiers for those needs.\n\nhttps://medium.com/@cathrans/draft-theories-of-change-e8d72234a5bf"
- "Anytime we find ourselves wanting to criticize, when we translate that criticism into our needs that isn't being met, we are far more likely to get our needs met, when we speak our needs than when we tell people what's wrong with them.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "After we have made clear expressions of what's alive in us, namely what we're observing, what we're feeling, what we're needing, if our need is not getting met, then we need to end on a clear request.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "In nonviolent communication, we tell people what we do want, rather than what we don't want.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "If people hear demands, it takes much of the joy away from doing anything. \n\nIt's much more likely to provoke resistance than cooperation.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "With many people, this is very hard to get them to trust that our requests are requests and not demands to whatever degree people carry memories, that when they don't do what other people want they have been criticized, guilted, blamed, punished.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "In nonviolent communication, we say what is alive in us: what we're observing, feeling, and needing. We make clear requests, presented, as best we can, in a way that people can trust it is a request and not a demand.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "To say no in a nonviolent communication way. We say the need that keeps us from saying yes.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Saying no in a nonviolent communication way:\n\n- Show an empathic reception of the request of the other person.\n\n- We don't say \"no\", we say the need that keeps us from saying yes.\n\nWe end with a request that searches for a way to get everybody's needs met."

- "The father could see that when he said, \"I want you to respect me\", he really wanted obedience. He could see, then, why the son reacted so negatively when he would ask for things.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "She said, Okay, Marshall, I got your point. I see what's going on. I see why I'm not getting my need for love met.\n\nWhy is that? What do you want him to do to meet your need for love?\n\nI want him to guess what I want before I know what it is, and I want him always to do it"
- "Needs are universal. All human beings have the same needs.\n\nThe second thing that differentiates a need from a strategy, a need contains no reference to specific actions. Anytime we say \"I want you to\" that's not an need, that's a request or a strategy."
- "State the feeling that the observation is triggering in you, or guess what the other person is feeling, and ask. Naming the emotion, without moral judgment, enables you to connect in a spirit of mutual respect and cooperation.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Make a concrete request for action to meet the need just identified. Ask clearly and specifically for what you want right now, rather than hinting or stating only what you don't want.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"

- "The most important part of empathy is the hardest.\n\nIt involves our presence, our full presence to what is alive in this person, at this moment.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "At university, we're trained to analyze people what leads them to behave as they do.\n\nThat kind of intellectual training and analysis, of what goes on historically that creates present problems, can get in the way of empathy.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "When we are giving a sympathetic response, we're talking about ourselves. This takes the focus away from what is alive in the other person.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Another thing we don't want to mix up is giving advice with empathy.\n\nVery often we think that we are showing understanding of people and we jump right in and start to give them advice.\n\n  #NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "In nonviolent communication as we'll see, we never say I understand.\n\nWe do something far more powerful. We demonstrate understanding.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Empathy takes place in the now. If the other person is telling me about some things that happened to their life in the past that caused great pain in them, I put my focus on what is alive in them now when they're telling me this.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "I was trained to try to help people connect the present problems they're having with things that happened earlier in their life to get them insights into this.\n\nIt took me quite a few years to realize how much more powerful it was for me to empathically connect with them, rather than to intellectually analyze how their problems began"
- "To interrupt them when you have heard more words than you want to hear, and when the words are not really connecting you clearly to what is alive in the person.\n\nSay, \"Excuse me\" and then what we say is to bring the conversation back to life, back to what is alive in this person at this moment, behind all the words."
- "For each item on the list then that I saw that I had been hiding parts of myself out of fear of somebody might saying this back to me. For every one of the messages, I practice sensing guessing what that person might be feeling and needing if they said that to me."
- "I don't have to worry about being honest with people and how they might respond. I only have to be prepared to empathically connect with whatever comes back. That means my power is in my hands. My security is in my hands. It's not in what other people think about me or say to me."
- "It's very important is to develop a consciousness that our needs are precious gift if they are expressed in a way in which we are not demanding that the person meet our request, in relationship to our needs.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "When we have this consciousness that our needs are a gift, we then express them with a totally different energy that makes it much easier for the other person to enjoy receiving our needs, and makes it much easier for them to respond out of the joy of giving."
- "If somebody says 'no' to us, that can't make us feel bad, it's how we interpret the no. We lose this consciousness as we get educated so that interdependence is not what happens in intimate relationships, but co-dependence, where people take on responsibility for each other's happiness."
- "If we're going to be good at expressing our needs, we want to be prepared to deal with somebody who gives us a diagnosis for having our needs.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Another problem that often makes it hard for people to enjoy giving in an intimate relationship is when their partner skips the need and just expresses their pain and goes immediately to a strategy.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "It's very important when we are in a good deal of pain about something, that we be conscious, it's by making the need clear and our feelings clear, when people have that focus, then specific strategies that are requested have a whole different case to them."
- "Nonviolent communication suggests we really make sure that everything we're doing is done willingly, out of an energy that comes when we are enriching life, and it's meeting our need to enrich life, so that we never feel as though we are sacrificing ourself for the other people."
- "Respect for authority, as I use the term, is manifest when we know things that people don't know, or can do things that they don't know how to do.\n\nThey see that these things are very valuable and they see that these things are being offered to them and not imposed upon them"
- "Fear of authority is usually built into the structure of either the family, the school, the business, the government.\n\nThis structure gives us the right to impose things on people. We can reward or punish, to get people to do what we want.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Obedience is maintained when people submit, because we have the power to either reward or punish.\n\nWilling cooperation only can be received when people feel free from this kind of coercion, and they trust that their needs as human beings are valued."
- "If we don't watch out, we give the institution the power to turn us into something other than what we are as a human being, we become the label\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Very often the institutions that we're in might not be set up to maintain the kind of values that we hold within ourselves.\n\nIt's extremely important that we learn how not to give away our power to authority. \n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "We don't give our power away to the authority to tell us what we are, we hear their humaneness behind their message.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "One of the things that I find very important to prepare our children with is to show them how to maintain their own integrity, their own value system, even if they are going to be in structures that have different values than they have.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "It's important that we not be obedient to authority, that we always recognize our choice. It's also important to recognize that rebellion is only halfway to being fully free. If we're rebelling against authority, we're still recognizing its power over us."
- "No matter what structure I'm in, they may control the environment, but they can't control me. I'm free within any structure, to choose what I want to do, and why I want to do it.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "I would like us all to do some wondering and on the basis of this wondering, take actions that free us from authority and institutions that function in ways that are not conducive to our living the lives we choose to live.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "I hope we are wondering whether we've fully developed our ability to see the humaneness of people in positions of authority, who aren't able to stay connected to their humaneness and who speak a language of domination and who use punitive tactics.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "When we get empathy for our pain, that exists as a result of what was stimulated by others, that contributes to healing.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "I want to be sure I'm hearing you.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "We haven't been educated to think in terms of what's alive in us, what we're feeling and needing. We've been educated to think of what we are.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "If we can recognize these thoughts when we're having them and translate them into unmet needs, we live in a different world\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "All of those judgments are really valuable messages – if we hear the truth – that what they're really trying to say is a need of mine is not getting met by what I'm doing\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Help people to become conscious that these judgments they're telling themselves, that create misery, contain valuable information if we can hear the needs that are not getting met.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"

- "Nonviolent communication provides us with skills for clearly expressing our needs without criticizing the other person\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "All judgments and criticisms of others are tragic expressions of our needs\n\n  #NVC #NonviolentCommunication"

- "We all have the same human needs\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Gangs that I'm worried about, some of them call themselves governments, some call themselves corporations – organizations of people that have a big impact over our lives, and are doing some things that I think contribute to great violence on the planet, and great suffering."
- "When we use the protective use of force, we don't see the other person as evil or bad and deserving of punishment. Our focus is on how we can stop what is creating the damage without being violent in the process\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "We met and looked at what actions could we take that would protect the children and help us create the connection with those who are doing the damage, so that we could have a dialogue with them, and come out with a way that would meet everybody's needs."
- "I showed them that I thought it would be more effective if we created signs that purely communicated our needs and our intent, but in no way implied that we saw the people at the school as evil or bad.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"

- "This process Nonviolent Communication has great power to enrich our lives, when it is our intention to create the connections necessary for compassionate giving to take place.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "It's a process that helps us to share that information with others, how to be honest and share what's alive in us – in a way that enables others to enjoy compassionately giving to us.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "A very important component in keeping this consciousness alive is the process of expressing gratitude to one another in a way that can be trusted that it's a celebration of life, and not a form of communication that's designed to manipulate us to do things that others want."
- "Our ability to express gratitude well, is highly correlated with how well we're able to express our pain, and receive empathy for our pain, and transform the pain.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "I went to the people that I didn't express my gratitude to, because I assumed that they knew it, and I asked them: Did you know?\n\nAnd half of them did and half of them didn't.\n\nBut even the ones who did know still told me they would have liked to have heard it."
