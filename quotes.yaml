- "Nonviolent Communication consists of a value system that we are trying to live by. It outlines a language, thinking, communication skills, and means of influence that support that way of living.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "I found that the tools of psychoanalytic therapy, and other trainings which were current at the time, didn't work very well.\n\nInstead of diagnosing what it was in people that's wrong with them, I decided to start with a different question: \n\nHow were we meant to live?"
- "The skills that seem necessary to live compassionately are quite different than the skills that we're taught.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Structures we're living in, where some claim to be superior and know what's right for others, requires a certain way of thinking, a certain language, and a certain use of power\n\nI saw that was the problem. What creates violence is that way of thinking, language, and use of power"
- "It was through studying [compassionate] people, and also some research in psychology, that I tried to identify what characteristics of development contribute to people's behaving in a compassionate way.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "I saw that the intention I wanted to live by, that I thought necessary for compassionate giving, is that we give solely out of the joy that comes naturally from contributing to life. Our own life and the lives of others.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "If our needs are not being fulfilled by what is happening, let us take action that fulfills our needs. If our needs are being fulfilled, let's celebrate.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Anytime we get people to do things out of fear that we're going to punish them if they don't, or out of shame or guilt, it's very costly. We are then experienced as a source of violence, as somebody who is prepared to make them suffer if they don't do what we want."

- "Anger tells us, in other words, that a need of ours isn't getting met, but our thinking doesn't connect with that need. Our connection goes to judging the other person who was the stimulus for our anger.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "I'm not saying there's anything wrong with being angry. That would be unfortunate if I come across that way, because a lot of people have been educated to think that if you're a nice person, you don't get angry. They've been taught to repress their anger. I'm certainly not saying that."
- "All language implying wrongness, criticism, insult, diagnosis of pathology of others, all such languages are the cause of anger.\n\nOther people are never the cause, only the stimulus.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"

- "In the exercise where I have asked people to identify what they tell themselves when they have made a mistake. Once they identify this thinking, I then suggest that they transform that thinking into the need that wasn't met, that stimulated the thinking."
- "We suggest that everyone build at least a vocabulary of about nine words that describe various needs that you have and see if one of those words, or more, resonate when you're blaming yourself.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Be conscious of what you tell yourself as a result of making the mistake, and translate the self-judgment into an unmet need. That's mourning.\n\nThen empathize with what need you were trying to meet by the action that we're calling a mistake. That's self forgiveness."
- "In my clinical training, I was taught to look at depression as an illness as a mental illness. I now come to see it in quite a different way. [...] I find that depression is created by people judging themselves in a way that creates that depression."
- "Once people identify these judgments that create their depression, I show them how to transform the judgments into unmet needs.\n\nWhat a different world we live in when we get connected to the need that isn't getting met, rather than stuck in the ways we judge ourselves."
- "When we think in the static language of what's wrong with us, that are we selfish, stupid, inconsiderate.\n\nWhen we have that language going on in us about ourselves, that doesn't lead to us getting our needs met.\n\nOur needs are buried behind that kind of thinking."
- "The structures we've been living under for a long time require people to be nice dead people.\n\nThey teach this language of blame, so that we're forever looking to authorities to see whether we're getting the right answer, or the wrong answer, whether we're judged as good or bad."
- "When we feel pleasurefull feelings, we know that our needs are being fulfilled. When we feel painful feelings, or unpleasant feelings, we know our needs are not being fulfilled.\n\nTo be fully alive requires a language of life. That requires a language of feelings and needs."
- "Other people can't make us feel anything. Our feelings are a result of how we take things. We cannot make other people feel as they do. They are responsible for how they take it.\n\nWe show we're not responsible for how other people feel. We are responsible for our actions."

- "Keep in mind that anything that's worth doing is worth doing poorly.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "We didn't judge students as bad, but we spoke honestly with them about whether or not their behavior was in harmony with our values or needs. We judge that way, but not judgments of a moralistic sort that implied wrongness.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "How concerned I am about thinking we have to be afraid of what other people might say or think about us.\n\nBy doing that, we're giving our power to other people.\n\nI tried to show people that we need to be concerned with how we respond the other person, not what they think of us."
- "That's where our safety is, in how we learn to respond to other people's judgments or criticism of us. Not to give our power away by thinking that our safety is solely how they might respond.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"

- "Never give the structure, or the people in it, the power to make you submit or rebel\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "No matter what structures we're in, never give the structure or its rules the power to determine what we do, so our actions come from choosing to act in harmony with our values.\n\nThis way, we're not submitting or rebelling. We're acting in harmony with our own values each moment"

- "This kind of honesty basically involves telling people what's alive in us, without using any words that criticize, and tell people what would make life more wonderful for us, what we are requesting, without presenting this as a demand, but presented as a request."
- "It's very important to be able to made clear observations to people, that tell them what language on their part is stimulating our needs being fulfilled, and what things that are doing that are not fulfilling our needs.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "We can learn by clear observations, but when the observations and evaluations are mixed together, so that it sounds like a criticism, it makes the evaluation period painful for both sides.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "When we tell people clearly our feelings and needs, we're letting them know what's alive in us when they do what they are doing, this is an evaluation based on life, not an evaluation, criticizes or blames.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "We have been living under domination cultures in which some people claim to be superiors and have a right to control others. People do not make good slaves when they are connected to life, and so feelings are not regarded as a positive thing to say.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Many women tell me what difficulty they have, expressing their needs. They have been taught that loving women have no needs, they sacrifice their needs for their families.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Men tell me how difficult it is to express their needs. How they have been taught that brave men have no needs, so they're willing to sacrifice their lives for the king or for the flag.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "In our training, we suggest to be sure that you learn how to be honest without any criticism without any blame, without any judgment of a kind where people hear that what they're doing is bad or wrong.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Manfred Max-Neef approach to economic success is based on whether human needs are met by all of the parties in the culture.\n\nSince his whole system of economy is based on human needs, he's gone to some trouble to research what are the basic human needs\n\nhttp://www.rainforestinfo.org.au/background/maxneef.htm"
- "Needs are also defined according to the existential categories of being, having, doing and interacting, and from these dimensions, a 36 cell matrix is developed which can be filled with examples of satisfiers for those needs.\n\nhttps://medium.com/@cathrans/draft-theories-of-change-e8d72234a5bf"
- "Anytime we find ourselves wanting to criticize, when we translate that criticism into our needs that isn't being met, we are far more likely to get our needs met, when we speak our needs than when we tell people what's wrong with them.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "After we have made clear expressions of what's alive in us, namely what we're observing, what we're feeling, what we're needing, if our need is not getting met, then we need to end on a clear request.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "In nonviolent communication, we tell people what we do want, rather than what we don't want.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "If people hear demands, it takes much of the joy away from doing anything. \n\nIt's much more likely to provoke resistance than cooperation.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "With many people, this is very hard to get them to trust that our requests are requests and not demands to whatever degree people carry memories, that when they don't do what other people want they have been criticized, guilted, blamed, punished.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "In nonviolent communication, we say what is alive in us: what we're observing, feeling, and needing. We make clear requests, presented, as best we can, in a way that people can trust it is a request and not a demand.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "To say no in a nonviolent communication way. We say the need that keeps us from saying yes.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Saying no in a nonviolent communication way:\n\n- Show an empathic reception of the request of the other person.\n\n- We don't say \"no\", we say the need that keeps us from saying yes.\n\nWe end with a request that searches for a way to get everybody's needs met."
- "My prediction is, the more conscious you are what you want back in the form of what you're requesting of your listener, you use fewer words and get more understanding.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "The father could see that when he said, \"I want you to respect me\", he really wanted obedience. He could see, then, why the son reacted so negatively when he would ask for things.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "She said, Okay, Marshall, I got your point. I see what's going on. I see why I'm not getting my need for love met.\n\nWhy is that? What do you want him to do to meet your need for love?\n\nI want him to guess what I want before I know what it is, and I want him always to do it"
- "Needs are universal. All human beings have the same needs.\n\nThe second thing that differentiates a need from a strategy, a need contains no reference to specific actions. Anytime we say \"I want you to\" that's not an need, that's a request or a strategy."
- "If we're addicted to our strategy, it's very easy for the other person to hear a request as a demand, this threatens their need for autonomy, and makes it harder for them to enjoy giving.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "State the feeling that the observation is triggering in you, or guess what the other person is feeling, and ask. Naming the emotion, without moral judgment, enables you to connect in a spirit of mutual respect and cooperation.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Make a concrete request for action to meet the need just identified. Ask clearly and specifically for what you want right now, rather than hinting or stating only what you don't want.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "See me beautiful, look for the best in me. \nThat's what I really am, and all I want to be. \nIt may take some time, it may be hard to find, but see me beautiful.\n\n  #NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "The most important part of empathy is the hardest.\n\nIt involves our presence, our full presence to what is alive in this person, at this moment.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "At university, we're trained to analyze people what leads them to behave as they do.\n\nThat kind of intellectual training and analysis, of what goes on historically that creates present problems, can get in the way of empathy.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "When we are giving a sympathetic response, we're talking about ourselves. This takes the focus away from what is alive in the other person.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Another thing we don't want to mix up is giving advice with empathy.\n\nVery often we think that we are showing understanding of people and we jump right in and start to give them advice.\n\n  #NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "In nonviolent communication as we'll see, we never say I understand.\n\nWe do something far more powerful. We demonstrate understanding.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Empathy takes place in the now. If the other person is telling me about some things that happened to their life in the past that caused great pain in them, I put my focus on what is alive in them now when they're telling me this.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "When we are making empathic connections, if somebody tells us what they think about us, we don't hear that.\n\nWe try never to hear what a person thinks about us.\n\nI really believe that if we learn how to hear the life behind these thoughts, will enjoy people more and live longer."
- "I was trained to try to help people connect the present problems they're having with things that happened earlier in their life to get them insights into this.\n\nIt took me quite a few years to realize how much more powerful it was for me to empathically connect with them, rather than to intellectually analyze how their problems began"
- "We need to do the same thing with the no as we do if somebody is telling us what's wrong with us, to hear through the message to what is alive in the person when they say this.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "To interrupt them when you have heard more words than you want to hear, and when the words are not really connecting you clearly to what is alive in the person.\n\nSay, \"Excuse me\" and then what we say is to bring the conversation back to life, back to what is alive in this person at this moment, behind all the words."
- "For each item on the list then that I saw that I had been hiding parts of myself out of fear of somebody might saying this back to me. For every one of the messages, I practice sensing guessing what that person might be feeling and needing if they said that to me."
- "I don't have to worry about being honest with people and how they might respond. I only have to be prepared to empathically connect with whatever comes back. That means my power is in my hands. My security is in my hands. It's not in what other people think about me or say to me."
- "It's very important is to develop a consciousness that our needs are precious gift if they are expressed in a way in which we are not demanding that the person meet our request, in relationship to our needs.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "When we have this consciousness that our needs are a gift, we then express them with a totally different energy that makes it much easier for the other person to enjoy receiving our needs, and makes it much easier for them to respond out of the joy of giving."
- "I can only be responsible for my own actions, my own intentions. The other person is responsible for how they take what I do, how they interpret it, and what they do to get their needs met.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "If somebody says 'no' to us, that can't make us feel bad, it's how we interpret the no. We lose this consciousness as we get educated so that interdependence is not what happens in intimate relationships, but co-dependence, where people take on responsibility for each other's happiness."
- "Well, the first step in saying no, is to make empathic connection with the other person's needs.\n\nThe empathic connection lets the other person know that we do care about their needs. We show that care by taking the time to stop and really connect with what's going on in them."
- "If we're going to be good at expressing our needs, we want to be prepared to deal with somebody who gives us a diagnosis for having our needs.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Another problem that often makes it hard for people to enjoy giving in an intimate relationship is when their partner skips the need and just expresses their pain and goes immediately to a strategy.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "It's very important when we are in a good deal of pain about something, that we be conscious, it's by making the need clear and our feelings clear, when people have that focus, then specific strategies that are requested have a whole different case to them."
- "Nonviolent communication suggests we really make sure that everything we're doing is done willingly, out of an energy that comes when we are enriching life, and it's meeting our need to enrich life, so that we never feel as though we are sacrificing ourself for the other people."
- "Respect for authority, as I use the term, is manifest when we know things that people don't know, or can do things that they don't know how to do.\n\nThey see that these things are very valuable and they see that these things are being offered to them and not imposed upon them"
- "Fear of authority is usually built into the structure of either the family, the school, the business, the government.\n\nThis structure gives us the right to impose things on people. We can reward or punish, to get people to do what we want.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "Obedience is maintained when people submit, because we have the power to either reward or punish.\n\nWilling cooperation only can be received when people feel free from this kind of coercion, and they trust that their needs as human beings are valued."
- "If we don't watch out, we give the institution the power to turn us into something other than what we are as a human being, we become the label\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"

- "It's extremely important that we learn how not to give away our power to authority. That no matter how people might make demands of us when they are in positions of authority, we hear it as a request and never as a demand.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "We don't give our power away to the authority to tell us what we are, we hear their humaneness behind their message.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
- "One of the things that I find very important to prepare our children with is to show them how to maintain their own integrity, their own value system, even if they are going to be in structures that have different values than they have.\n\n#NVC #NonviolentCommunication"
